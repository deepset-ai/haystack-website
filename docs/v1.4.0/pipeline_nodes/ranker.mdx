# Ranker

A Ranker reorders a set of Documents based on their relevance to the Query.
It is particularly useful when your Retriever has high recall but poor relevance scoring.
The improvement that the Ranker brings comes at the cost of some additional computation time.
The ranking models supported by Haystack are
models powered by transformers, meaning that they are sensitive to word order and syntax.

In Haystack, you can use any [Cross-Encoder](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder) model that returns a single logit
as a similarity score.
See this [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained-models/ce-msmarco.html#usage-with-transformers) page for some examples.

## Usage

To use the Ranker in a pipeline:

```python
from haystack.document_stores import ElasticsearchDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import ElasticsearchRetriever, SentenceTransformersRanker
from haystack import Pipeline

document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore()
...
retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever(document_store)
ranker = SentenceTransformersRanker(model_name_or_path="cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2")
...
p = Pipeline()
p.add_node(component=retriever, name="ESRetriever", inputs=["Query"])
p.add_node(component=ranker, name="Ranker", inputs=["ESRetriever"])
```

The `SentenceTransformersRanker` can also be used in isolation by calling its `predict()` method after initialization.

## Use Case

As an example, a Ranker can pair nicely with a sparse BM25 retriever such as the ElasticsearchRetriever.
While the BM25 retriever is fast and lightweight, it is not sensitive to word order but rather treats text as a bag of words.
By placing a Ranker afterwards, you can offset this weakness and have a better sorted list of relevant documents.

## Training

The Ranker needs to be initialised with a model trained on a text pair classification task.
The `SentenceTransformersRanker` has a `train()` method to allow for this training.
Alternatively, [this FARM script](https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/examples/text_pair_classification.py) shows how to train a text pair classification model.
