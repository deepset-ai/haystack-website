# Table Question Answering

Unlock the information stored in your tables using Haystack.
Using the `TableReader` and the `TableTextRetriever`, you can now perform open domain question answering on tabular data.

## Indexing Data

To index data, cast your tables into pandas DataFrame format and use them to initialize `Document` objects.
Then write them into your document store using the `write_documents()` method.

```
from haystack import Document
import pandas as pd

table = pd.DataFrame()
docs = [
    Document(content=table,
             content_type="table",
             meta={}),
    ...
]
document_store.write_documents(docs)
```

If you have your tables embedded in raw files (e.g. within a PDF), you can use the `AzureConverter` to parse them into the required format (see [File Converters](/pipeline_nodes/v1.4.0/file-converters)).

## Retrieval

The `TableTextRetriever` is designed to perform document retrieval on both text and tabular documents.
It is a tri-encoder model with a separate encoder for the query, text passage and table.
To learn more about the design of this component and also the training of the default models,
have a look at [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04049) which was accepted at EMNLP 2021.

```
retriever = TableTextRetriever(
    document_store=document_store,
    query_embedding_model="deepset/bert-small-mm_retrieval-question_encoder",
    passage_embedding_model="deepset/bert-small-mm_retrieval-passage_encoder",
    table_embedding_model="deepset/bert-small-mm_retrieval-table_encoder",
    embed_meta_fields=["title", "section_title"]
)
document_store.update_embeddings(retriever=retriever)
```

## TableReader

With the `TableReader`, you can get answers to your questions even if the answer is buried in a table.
It is designed to use the [TAPAS](https://github.com/google-research/tapas) model created by Google.
These models are able to pick out single cells,
or a set of cells and perform an aggregation operating to form a final answer.

```
reader = TableReader(model_name_or_path="google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq", max_seq_len=512)
```

<div className="max-w-xl bg-yellow-light-theme border-l-8 border-yellow-dark-theme px-6 pt-6 pb-4 my-4 rounded-md dark:bg-yellow-900">

**Note:** When the [Answers](/components/v1.4.0/documents-answers-labels#answers) are returned by the `TableReader`,
the offsets indicate the cells that answer the question.
These offsets are start and end indices when counting through the table in a linear fashion
i.e. first cell is top left and last cell is bottom right.

</div>

<div className="max-w-xl bg-yellow-light-theme border-l-8 border-yellow-dark-theme px-6 pt-6 pb-4 my-4 rounded-md dark:bg-yellow-900">

**Note:** In the `Answer`'s `meta` field, you will find the aggregation operator used to combine a set of cells into a final answer.

</div>

## Pipeline

All the table QA components can be combined together in a pipeline.

```
table_qa_pipeline = Pipeline()
table_qa_pipeline.add_node(component=retriever, name="TableTextRetriever", inputs=["Query"])
table_qa_pipeline.add_node(component=reader, name="TableReader", inputs=["TableTextRetriever"])
```

You can run queries on this pipeline as follows.

```
prediction = table_qa_pipeline.run("How many twin buildings are under construction?")
```

The output of the pipeline is compatible with the `print_answers()` utility function

```
from haystack.utils import print_answers

print_answers(prediction, details="minimal")
```
