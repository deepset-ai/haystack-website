# JoinAnswers

The `JoinAnswers` node takes Answers from two or more Reader or Generator nodes and joins them to produce a single list of answers.

## Usage

To initialize the Node:

```python
from haystack.nodes import JoinAnswers

join_answers = JoinAnswers(
    join_mode="concatenate",
    sort_by_score=True
)
```

There are two available `join_mode`s:
- `concatenate`: Combines documents from multiple readers
- `merge`: Aggregates scores of individual answers. If you use this option, you can also specify the `weights` parameter which assigns importance to the input nodes. By default, all nodes are assigned equal weight.

Optionally, you can use the `top_k` parameter to specify the number of answers to be displayed.

<div className="max-w-xl bg-yellow-light-theme border-l-8 border-yellow-dark-theme px-6 pt-6 pb-4 my-4 rounded-md dark:bg-yellow-900">

**Note:** Answers coming from a Generator have no score.
You will need to set `sort_by_score=False` to join these with Answers coming from other sources.

</div>

## Use Case

A typical use case for `JoinAnswers` is as follows:
- Your documents contain different types of data, for example tables and text
- You use the `RouteDocuments` node to split your documents by content type
- You use a different reader for each document type and you get predicted answers form each reader separately
- You use the `JoinAnswers` node to join the answers in a single list

Here's what an example pipeline with the `JoinAnswers` node could look like:
