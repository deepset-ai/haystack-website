# Query Classifier

Classifying queries lets you route them to specific branches of your pipeline that are better suited to handling them, giving you better search results.
The QueryClassifier populates the metadata fields of the query with the classification label and can also handle the routing.

For example, you can route keyword queries to a less computationally expensive sparse Retriever, while passing questions to a dense Retriever, thus saving you time and GPU resources.
The QueryClassifier can also categorize queries by topic and, based on that, route them to the appropriate database.

## Usage

You can use the QueryClassifier as a stand-alone node in which case it returns two objects: the query and the name of the output edge. To do so, run:

```python
from haystack.nodes import TransformersQueryClassifier

queries = ["Arya Stark father","Jon Snow UK",
           "who is the father of arya stark?","Which country was jon snow filmed in?"]

question_classifier = TransformersQueryClassifier(model_name_or_path="shahrukhx01/bert-mini-finetune-question-detection")
# Or Sklearn based:

for query in queries:
    result = question_classifier.run(query=query)
    if result[1] == "output_1":
        category = "question"
    else:
        category = "keywords"

    print(f"Query: {query}, raw_output: {result}, class: {category}")

# Returns:
# Query: Arya Stark father, raw_output: ({'query': 'Arya Stark father'}, 'output_2'), class: keywords
# Query: Jon Snow UK, raw_output: ({'query': 'Jon Snow UK'}, 'output_2'), class: keywords
# Query: who is the father of arya stark?, raw_output: ({'query': 'who is the father of arya stark?'}, 'output_1'), class: question
# Query: Which country was jon snow filmed in?, raw_output: ({'query': 'Which country was jon snow filmed in?'}, 'output_1'), class: question
```

To use the QueryClassifier within a pipeline as a [decision node](/pipeline_nodes/overview#decision-nodes), run:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline
from haystack.nodes import TransformersQueryClassifier
from haystack.utils import print_answers

query_classifier = TransformersQueryClassifier(model_name_or_path="shahrukhx01/bert-mini-finetune-question-detection")

pipe = Pipeline()
pipe.add_node(component=query_classifier, name="QueryClassifier", inputs=["Query"])
pipe.add_node(component=dpr_retriever, name="DensePassageRetriever", inputs=["QueryClassifier.output_1"])
pipe.add_node(component=bm25_retriever, name="BM25Retriever", inputs=["QueryClassifier.output_2"])

# Pass a question -> run DPR
res_1 = pipe.run(query="Who is the father of Arya Stark?")

# Pass keywords -> run the BM25Retriever
res_2 = pipe.run(query="arya stark father")
```

Here, the query is processed by only one branch of the pipeline, depending on the output of the QueryClassifier.

## Classifying Keyword, Question, and Statement Queries

    options={[
        {
            title: "Keyword",
            content: (
                <div>
                    Keyword queries don't have sentence structure. They consist of keywords and the order of words does not matter. For example:
                    <li>arya stark father</li>
                    <li>jon snow country</li>
                    <li>arya stark younger brothers</li>
                </div>
            )
        },
        {
            title: "Question",
            content: (
                <div>
                    In such queries, users ask a question in a complete, grammatical sentence. A QueryClassifier can classify a query regardless of whether it ends with a question mark or not. Examples of questions:
                    <li>who is the father of arya stark?</li>
                    <li>which country was jon snow filmed in</li>
                    <li>who are the younger brothers of arya stark?</li>
                </div>
            )
        },
        {
            title: "Statement",
            content: (
                <div>
                    This type of query is a declarative sentence, such as:
                    <li>Arya stark was a daughter of a lord.</li>
                    <li>Show countries that Jon snow was filmed in.</li>
                    <li>List all brothers of Arya.</li>
                </div>
            )
        }
    ]}
/>

One recommended setup would be to route both questions and statements to a DensePassageRetriever, which is better accustomed to these types, while routing keyword queries to an ElasticsearchRetriever to save GPU resources.

You can see a code example of this configuration in [Usage](/pipeline_nodes/query-classifier#usage).
This pipeline has a `TransformersQueryClassifier` that routes questions and statements to the node's `output_1` and keyword queries to `output_2`.
The DensePassageRetriever takes its input from `QueryClassifier.output_1` and the ESRetriever from `QueryClassifier.output_2`.

An alternative setup is to route questions to a question answering branch and keywords to a document search branch:

```python
haystack.pipeline import TransformersQueryClassifier, Pipeline
from haystack.utils import print_answers

query_classifier = TransformersQueryClassifier(model_name_or_path="shahrukhx01/question-vs-statement-classifier")

pipe = Pipeline()
pipe.add_node(component=query_classifier, name="QueryClassifier", inputs=["Query"])
pipe.add_node(component=dpr_retriever, name="DPRRetriever", inputs=["QueryClassifier.output_1"])
pipe.add_node(component=bm25_retriever, name="BM25", inputs=["QueryClassifier.output_2"])
pipe.add_node(component=reader, name="QAReader", inputs=["DPRRetriever"])

# Pass a question -> run DPR + QA -> return answers
res_1 = pipe.run(query="Who is the father of Arya Stark?")

# Pass keywords -> run only BM25Retriever -> return Documents
res_2 = pipe.run(query="arya stark father")
```

### Models

To perform this classification of keywords, questions, and statements, you can use either the TransformersQueryClassifier or SkLearnQueryClassifier.
The TransformersQueryClassifier is more accurate than the SkLearnQueryClassifier as it is sensitive to the syntax of a sentence.
However, it requires more memory and a GPU to run quickly.
You can mitigate those downsides by choosing a smaller transformer model.
The default model used in the TransformerQueryClassifier is `shahrukhx01/bert-mini-finetune-question-detection`.
We trained this model using a mini BERT architecture of about 50 MB in size, which allows relatively fast inference on the CPU.

## Zero-Shot Classification

While most classification models, like the ones in the examples above, have a predefined set of labels, zero-shot classification models can perform classification with any set of labels you define.
To initialize a zero-shot QueryClassifier, run:

```python
 # In zero-shot-classification, you can choose the labels
 labels = ["music", "cinema"]

 query_classifier = TransformersQueryClassifier(
     model_name_or_path="typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli",
     use_gpu=True,
     task="zero-shot-classification",
     labels=labels,
 )
 ```

Here the `labels` variable defines which labels you want the QueryClassifier to use. The model you pick should be a natural language inference model such as those trained on [the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli) dataset.

To perform the classification, run:

 ```python
 queries = [
     "In which films does John Travolta appear?",  # query about cinema
     "What is the Rolling Stones first album?",  # query about music
     "Who was Sergio Leone?",  # query about cinema
 ]

 import pandas as pd

# This object will contain results of the classification.
# The "Query" key will contain a list of queries.
# The "Output Branch" key will contain which branches the queries was routed through.
# The "Class" key will contain the classification label of each query.
 query_classification_results = {"Query": [], "Output Branch": [], "Class": []}

 for query in queries:
     result = query_classifier.run(query=query)
     query_classification_results["Query"].append(query)
     query_classification_results["Output Branch"].append(result[1])
     query_classification_results["Class"].append("music" if result[1] == "output_1" else "cinema")

 pd.DataFrame.from_dict(query_classification_results)
 ```
