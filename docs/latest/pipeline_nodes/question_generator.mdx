# Question Generator

Question Answering systems are trained to find an answer given a question and a document;
but with the recent advances in generative NLP, there are now models that can read a document
and suggest questions that can be answered by that document.
All this power is available to you now via the `QuestionGenerator` class.

`QuestionGenerator` models can be trained using Question Answering datasets.
Instead of predicting answers, the `QuestionGenerator` takes the document as input and is trained to output the questions.

**Note: ** The `QuestionGenerator` is different to the `Generator`.
The `QuestionGenerator` receives only documents as input and returns questions as output
while the `Generator` class is an alternative to the `Reader`.
It takes a question and documents as input and returns an answer.

## Stand-Alone Usage

``` python
from haystack.nodes import QuestionGenerator

text = """Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum
and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
readability with its notable use of significant whitespace."""

qg = QuestionGenerator()
result = qg.generate(text)
```

The output will look like this:

``` python
[' Who created Python?',
 ' When was Python first released?',
 " What is Python's design philosophy?"]
```

## Ready-Made Pipelines

In Haystack, there are 2 pipeline configurations that are already encapsulated in its own class.
- `QuestionGenerationPipeline`
- `QuestionAnswerGenerationPipeline`

Have a look at our [ready-made pipelines page](/components/ready-made-pipelines) to learn more about them.
Check out the question generation [tutorial](/tutorials/question-generation) to start using them.

## Use Case: Auto-Suggested Questions

Generated questions can help users get closer to the information that they are looking for.
Search engines now present auto-suggested questions to your top search results and even present suggested answers.
It is possible to build this same functionality in Haystack using the `QuestionGenerator`.

After your `Retriever` has returned some candidate documents, you can run the `QuestionGenerator` to suggest more answerable questions.
By presenting these generated questions to your users, you can give them a sense of other facts and topics that are present in the documents.
You can go even on step further by predicting answers to these questions with a `Reader` or `Generator`.

## Use Case: Human in the Loop Annotation

A `QuestionGenerator` can enable different annotation workflows.
For example, given a text corpus, you could use the `QuestionGenerator` to create questions,
but you can also use then use a `Reader` to predict answers.

Correct QA pairs created in this manner might not be so effective in retraining your `Reader` model.
However, correcting wrong QA pairs creates training samples that your model found challenging.
These examples are likely to be impactful when it comes to retraining.
This is also a quicker workflow than having annotators generate both question and answer.
