# RouteDocuments

The `RouteDocuments` Node is a decision Node that makes it possible to route documents
to different branches of your Pipeline based on their `content_type` or a metadata field.

This node is handy if you have different types of data, for example tables and text.
You can then use it to route each document type to a Reader trained on it.

## Usage

By default `RouteDocuments` routes Documents based on content type (e.g. text vs table).

```python
route_documents = RouteDocuments()
```

You can also initialize `RouteDocuments` to route based on a metadata field.
The following example shows how to initialize the class if you have a metadata field called `language`
with `de`, `en` and `es` as the possible values.

```python
route_documents = RouteDocuments(
    split_by="language",
    metadata_values=["de", "en", "es"]
)
```
