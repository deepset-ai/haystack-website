# RouteDocuments

The `RouteDocuments` node makes it possible to split documents by `content_type` or a metadata field. It takes a list of documents as input and seggregates them by either `content_type` or a meta value. 

This node is handy if you have different types of data, for example tables and text. You can then use it to route each document type to a Reader trained on it. 

## Usage

You can initialize `RouteDocuments` to split documents by content type, which is the default method. This means that documents are split into documents containing text and documents containing tables. To initialize `RouteDocuments` this way, run:

```python
route_documents = RouteDocuments()
```

You can also initialize `RouteDocuments` to split documents based on a metadata field. To do this, specify the medatada and its values when initializing the node. For example, if your documents contain a metadata field called `language` and you want to split your documents into German, English, and Spanish documents, here's how you initiate `RouteDocuments`:

```python
route_documents() = RouteDocuments(split_by="language", metadata_values=["de", "en", "es"])
```
