# Retriever

The Retriever performs Document Retrieval by sweeping through a document store and returning a set of candidate documents that are relevant to the query.

When used in combination with a Reader, it can quickly sift out irrelevant documents,
saving the Reader from doing more work than it needs to, and speeding up the querying process.

The Retriever is tightly coupled with the Document Store. You must specify a Document Store when initializing the Retriever.
While the Retriever functions as a Node in the Pipeline, the Document Store does not.
When the Retriever runs, it receives a Query as input. It then uses the Query to check the documents contained in the Document Store,
and to pass on the best candidates.

If you're unsure which Retriever to use, see the sections below explaining each Retriever type.
Our starting recommendations are to use an EmbeddingRetriever if you can use GPU acceleration.
If you can't use GPU, we recommend the BM25Retriever.

## Usage

To initialize a Retriever, pass a Document Store as its argument:

```python
from haystack.nodes import BM25Retriever

retriever = BM25Retriever(document_store)
```

To run a Retriever on its own, use the `retrieve()` method. It returns a list of Document objects:

```python
candidate_documents = retriever.retrieve(
    query="international climate conferences",
    top_k=10,
    filters={"year": ["2015", "2016", "2017"]}
)
```

To run a Retriever within a ready-made Pipeline:

```python
from haystack.pipelines import DocumentSearchPipeline

pipeline = DocumentSearchPipeline(retriever=retriever)

result = pipeline.run(
    query="international climate conferences",
    params={
        "Retriever": {
            "top_k": 10,
            "filters": {"year": ["2015", "2016", "2017"]}
        }
    }
)
```

## Document Store Compatibility

Note that not all Retrievers can be paired with every DocumentStore.
Here are the combinations which are supported:

|           | InMemory | Elasticsearch | OpenSearch | OpenDistroElasticsearch | SQL | FAISS | Milvus | Weaviate | Pinecone | DeepsetCloud |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | --- | ----- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BM25      | N      | Y             | Y          | Y                       | N   | N     | N      | N        | N        | Y |   
| TF-IDF    | Y      | Y             | Y          | Y                       | Y   | N     | N      | Y        | Y        | Y |

See [Optimization](/guides/optimization) for suggestions on how to choose top-k values.

## Table Retrieval

The `TableTextRetriever` is designed to perform document retrieval on both text and tabular documents.
It is a tri-encoder model with a separate encoder for the query, text passage, and table.

To learn more about how to use this component in Haystack, have a look at our [Table Question Answering](/guides/table-qa) guide.

## BM25 (Recommended)

Use BM25 if you are looking for a retrieval method that doesn't need a neural network for indexing.
BM25 is a variant of [TF-IDF](https://haystack.deepset.ai/pipeline_nodes/retriever#tf-idf).
It improves upon its predecessor in two main aspects:

- It saturates `tf` after a set number of occurrences of the given term in the document

- It normalises by document length so that short documents are favoured over long documents if they have the same amount of word overlap with the query

```python
from haystack.document_stores import ElasticsearchDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import BM25Retriever
from haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline

document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore()
...
retriever = BM25Retriever(document_store)
...
p = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)
```

For more information about the algorithm, see [BM25 algorithm](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-2-the-bm25-algorithm-and-its-variables).

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

## Embedding Retrieval (Recommended)

In Haystack, you have the option of using a transformer model to encode document and query.
One style of model that is suited to this kind of retrieval is [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/index.html).
These models are trained in Siamese Networks and use triplet loss such that they learn to embed similar sentences near to each other in a shared embedding space.

Some models have been fine-tuned on massive Information Retrieval data
and can be used to retrieve documents based on a short query (for example, `multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1`).
There are others that are more suited to semantic similarity tasks where you are trying to find
the most similar documents to a given document (for example, `all-mpnet-base-v2`).
There are even models that are multilingual (for example, `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`).
For a good overview of different models with their evaluation metrics,
see [Pretrained models](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html#) in the Sentence Transformers documentation.

If you are interested in using a Sentence Transformers model as an `EmbeddingRetriever`,
you should set the `model_format="sentence_transformers"`.

**Tip**

When using Sentence Transformer models, we recommend referring to
their [Model Overview](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html#) to pick the best similarity function
and also to find its embedding dimensions.

</div>

```python
from haystack.document_stores import ElasticsearchDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import EmbeddingRetriever
from haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline

document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore(
    similarity="dot_product",
    embedding_dim=768
)
retriever = EmbeddingRetriever(
    document_store=document_store,
   embedding_model="sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1",
   model_format="sentence_transformers"
)
document_store.update_embeddings(retriever)
...
p = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)
```

## Dense Passage Retrieval

[Dense Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) is a highly performant retrieval method that calculates relevance using dense representations.
Key features:

- One BERT base model to encode documents

- One BERT base model to encode queries

- Ranking of documents done by dot product similarity between query and document embeddings

Indexing using DPR is comparatively expensive in terms of required computation since all documents in the database need to be processed through the transformer.
The embeddings that are created in this step can be stored in FAISS, a database optimized for vector similarity.
DPR can also work with the ElasticsearchDocumentStore or the InMemoryDocumentStore.

There are two design decisions that have made DPR particularly performant.

- Separate encoders for document and query helps since queries are much shorter than documents

- Training with ‘In-batch negatives’ (gold labels are treated as negative examples for other samples in same batch) is highly efficient

In Haystack, you can simply download the pretrained encoders needed to start using DPR.
To learn how to set up a DPR-based system, have a look at the [Dense Passage Retrieval tutorial](/tutorials/dense-passage-retrieval).

<div className="max-w-xl bg-yellow-light-theme border-l-8 border-yellow-dark-theme px-6 pt-6 pb-4 my-4 rounded-md dark:bg-yellow-900">

**Tip**

When using DPR, it is recommended that you use the `dot product` similarity function since that is how it is trained.
To do so, simply provide `similarity="dot_product"` when initializing the DocumentStore
as in the code example below.

</div>

```python
from haystack.document_stores import FAISSDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import DensePassageRetriever
from haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline

document_store = FAISSDocumentStore(similarity="dot_product")
...
retriever = DensePassageRetriever(
    document_store=document_store,
    query_embedding_model="facebook/dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base",
    passage_embedding_model="facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base"
)
...
pipeline = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)
```

<div className="max-w-xl bg-yellow-light-theme border-l-8 border-yellow-dark-theme px-6 pt-6 pb-4 my-4 rounded-md dark:bg-yellow-900">

**Training DPR:** Haystack supports training of your own DPR model! Check out the [tutorial](/tutorials/train-dpr) to see how this is done!

## TF-IDF

TF-IDF is a commonly used baseline for information retrieval that exploits two key intuitions:

- Documents that have more lexical overlap with the query are more likely to be relevant

- Words that occur in fewer documents are more significant than words that occur in many documents

Given a query, a tf-idf score is computed for each document as follows:

```python
score = tf * idf
```

Where:

- `tf` is how many times words in the query occur in that document.

- `idf` is the inverse of the fraction of documents containing the word.

In practice, both terms are usually log normalised.

```python
from haystack.document_stores import InMemoryDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import TfidfRetriever
from haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline

document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()
...
retriever = TfidfRetriever(document_store)
...
p = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)
```

## Deeper Dive: Dense vs Sparse

Broadly speaking, there are two categories of retrieval methods: **dense** and **sparse**.

**Sparse** methods, like TF-IDF and BM25, operate by looking for shared keywords between the document and the query.
These methods:

- Are simple but effective

- Don’t need to be trained

- Work on any language

More recently, **dense** approaches such as Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) have shown even better performance than their sparse counter parts.
These methods embed both document and query into a shared embedding space using deep neural networks
and the top candidates are the nearest neighbour documents to the query.
They are:

- Powerful but computationally more expensive, especially during indexing

- Trained using labelled datasets

- Language specific

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

### Qualitative Differences

Between these two types, there are also some qualitative differences.
For example, sparse methods treat text as a bag-of-words meaning that they **do not take word order and syntax into account**,
while the latest generation of dense methods use transformer based encoders
which are designed to be **sensitive** to these factors.

Also dense methods are very capable of building strong semantic representations of text,
but they **struggle when encountering out-of-vocabulary** words such as new names.
By contrast, sparse methods don’t need to learn representations of words,
they only care about whether they are present or absent in the text.
As such, **they handle out-of-vocabulary words with no problem**.

<!-- _comment: !! Show example from DPR paper? !! -->

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

### Indexing

Dense methods perform indexing by processing all the documents through a neural network and storing the resulting vectors.
This is a much more expensive operation than creating the inverted-index used in sparse methods
and requires significant computational power and time.

<!-- _comment: !!See their individual sections (!! link !!) for more details on this point. Benchmarks too !! -->

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

### Terminology

<!-- _comment: !! Diagram of what a sparse vector looks like vs dense vector. !! -->
<!-- _comment: !! This section should be turned into something more like a side note !! -->

The terms **dense** and **sparse** refer to the representations that the algorithms build for each document and query.
**Sparse** methods characterize texts using vectors with one dimension corresponding to each word in the vocabulary.
Dimensions are zero if the word is absent and non-zero if it is present.
Since most documents contain only a small subset of the full vocabulary,
these vectors are considered sparse since non-zero values are few and far between.

**Dense** methods, by contrast, pass text as input into neural network encoders
and represent text in a vector of a manually defined size (usually 768).
Though individual dimensions are not mapped to any corresponding vocabulary or linguistic feature,
each dimension encodes some information about the text.
There are rarely 0s in these vectors hence their relative density.
