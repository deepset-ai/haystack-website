# PreProcessor

The PreProcessor can perform different kinds of preprocessing on a `Document`:

- normalization of white space
- splitting of text into smaller pieces

Splitting is generally recommended where long `Document`s are involved
since this can improve the performance of retrieval
and speed up Question Answering.
For suggestions on how best to split your documents, see [Optimization](/guides/optimization)

## Usage

```python
from haystack.nodes import PreProcessor

doc = converter.convert(file_path=file, meta=None)
processor = PreProcessor(
    clean_empty_lines=True,
    clean_whitespace=True,
    clean_header_footer=True,
    split_by="word",
    split_length=200,
    split_respect_sentence_boundary=True,
    split_overlap=0
)
docs = processor.process(doc)
```

- `clean_empty_lines` will normalize 3 or more consecutive empty lines to be just a two empty lines
- `clean_whitespace` will remove any whitespace at the beginning or end of each line in the text
- `clean_header_footer` will remove any long header or footer texts that are repeated on each page
- `split_by` determines what unit the document is split by: `'word'`, `'sentence'` or `'passage'`
- `split_length` sets a maximum number of `'word'`, `'sentence'` or `'passage'` units per output document
- `split_respect_sentence_boundary` ensures that document boundaries do not fall in the middle of sentences
- `split_overlap` sets the amount of overlap between two adjacent documents after a split. Setting this to a positive number essentially enables the sliding window approach.

## Document Format

When you are not using an indexing Pipeline, the PreProcessor can take either `Document` objects (recommended)
as input or plain dictionaries.
To learn more about the `Document` class see [Documents, Answers and Labels](/components/documents-answers-labels).

```python
# Option 1: Native Haystack Documents
docs = [
    Document(
        content='DOCUMENT_TEXT_HERE',
        meta={'name': DOCUMENT_NAME, ...}
        ...
    ), ...
]

# Option 2: Plain dict
docs = [
    {
        'content': 'DOCUMENT_TEXT_HERE',
        'meta': {'name': DOCUMENT_NAME, ...}
    }, ...
]
```
