# Summarizer

The Summmarizer is a useful tool for getting a short overview of a Document that is otherwise quite long.
Using the Summarizer, you could, for example, gain a more manageable glimpse into what Documents your Retriever is returning.

You can use any summarization model from HuggingFace Transformers by providing the model name.
See the up-to-date list of available models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=summarization).
By default, the Google [Pegasus](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/pegasus-state-of-art-model-for.html) model is loaded.

## Usage

```python
from haystack.nodes import TransformersSummarizer
from haystack import Document

docs = [Document("PG&E stated it scheduled the blackouts in response to forecasts for high winds amid dry conditions.\
                 The aim is to reduce the risk of wildfires. Nearly 800 thousand customers were scheduled to be affected by\
                 the shutoffs which were expected to last through at least midday tomorrow.")]

summarizer = TransformersSummarizer(model_name_or_path="google/pegasus-xsum")
summary = summarizer.predict(documents=docs, generate_single_summary=True)
```

The contents of summary should contain both the summarization and also the original document text.

```python
[
    {
        "text": "California's largest electricity provider has turned off power to hundreds of thousands of customers.",
        "meta": {
            "context": "PGE stated it scheduled the blackouts in response to forecasts for high winds amid dry conditions."
        },
        ...
    }
]
```

The summarizer can also functions as a node in a pipeline.

```python
from haystack import Pipeline

p = Pipeline()
p.add_node(component=retriever, name="ESRetriever1", inputs=["Query"])
p.add_node(component=summarizer, name="Summarizer", inputs=["ESRetriever1"])
res = p.run(query="What did Einstein work on?")
```
