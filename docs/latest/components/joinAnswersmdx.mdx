# JoinAnswers

The `JoinAnswers` node takes answers from two individual Reader nodes as input and joins them to product a single list of answers. 

A typical use case for `JoinAnswers` is as follows:
- Your documents contain different types of data, for example tables and text
- You use the `RouteDocuments` node to split your documents by content type
- You use a different reader for each document type and you get predicted answers form each reader separately
- You use the `JoinAnswers` node to join the answers in a single list 

Here's what an example pipeline with the `JoinAnswers` node could look like:

## Usage

When initializing this node, you must specify the join mode that you want to use. There are two modes available:
- `concatenate` Combines documnets from multiple readers
- `merge` Aggregates scores of individual answers. If you use this option, you can also specify the `weights` parameter which assigns importance to the input nodes. By default, all nodes are assigned equal weight.

Optionally, you can use the `top_k` parameter to specify the number of answers to be displayed.

```python
join_answers = JoinAnswers(join_mode="concatenate")
```
