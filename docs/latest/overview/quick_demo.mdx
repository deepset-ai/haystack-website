## Local

Start up a Haystack service via Docker Compose.
With this you can begin calling it directly via the REST API or even interact with it using the included Streamlit UI.

**1. Update/install Docker and Docker Compose, then launch Docker**

```
    apt-get update && apt-get install docker && apt-get install docker-compose
    service docker start
```

**2. Clone Haystack repository**

```
    git clone https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git
```

**3. Pull images & launch demo app**

```
    cd haystack
    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up

    # Or on a GPU machine: docker-compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up
```

You should be able to see the following in your terminal window as part of the log output:

```
..
ui_1             |   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
..
ui_1             |   External URL: http://192.168.108.218:8501
..
haystack-api_1   | [2021-01-01 10:21:58 +0000] [17] [INFO] Application startup complete.
```

**4. Open the Streamlit UI for Haystack by pointing your browser to the "External URL" from above.**

You should see the following:

You can then try different queries against a pre-defined set of indexed articles related to Game of Thrones.

**Note**: The following containers are started as a part of this demo:

* Haystack API: listens on port 8000
* DocumentStore (Elasticsearch): listens on port 9200
* Streamlit UI: listens on port 8501

Please note that the demo will [publish](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/) the container ports to the outside world. *We suggest that you review the firewall settings depending on your system setup and the security guidelines.*
