## Why Use Pipelines for Search?

The value of chaining together different Nodes is clearest when looking at the Retriever-Reader Pipeline.
It is one of the most common systems built in Haystack and it
harnesses the reading comprehension power of the [Reader](/pipeline_nodes/reader)
but also applies it to large document bases with the help of the [Retriever](/pipeline_nodes/retriever).

**Readers**, also known as Closed-Domain Question Answering systems in Machine Learning speak,
are powerful models that do close analysis of documents and perform the core task of question answering.
The Readers in Haystack are trained from the latest transformer based language models and can be significantly sped up using GPU acceleration.
However, it is not currently feasible to use the Reader directly on large collection of documents.

The **Retriever** assists the Reader by acting as a lightweight filter that reduces the number of documents that the Reader has to process.
It does this by scanning through all documents in the database and quickly identifying the relevant and dismissing the irrelevant.
In the end, only a small set of candidate documents are passed on to the Reader.

```
p = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)
result = p.run(query="What is the capital of Australia?")
```

Using just a Retriever will not enable users to perform question answering.
And using just a Reader would be unacceptably slow.
The power of this system comes from the combination of the two.

The Retriever-Reader pipeline is by no means the only one that Haystack offers,
but it is perhaps the most instructive for showing the gains from combining Nodes.
Many of the synergistic Node combinations are covered by our [Ready Made Pipelines](/components/ready-made-pipelines)
but we are sure there many still to be discovered!
