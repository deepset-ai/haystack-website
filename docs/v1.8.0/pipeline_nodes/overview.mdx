# Pipeline Nodes

Nodes are the core components that process and route incoming text.
Some perform steps like preprocessing, retrieving, or summarizing text
while routing queries through different branches of a Pipeline.
Nodes are chained together using a [Pipeline](/components/v1.8.0/pipelines)
and they function like building blocks that can be easily switched out for each other.
A Node takes the output of the previous Node (or Nodes) as input.

## Usage

All Nodes are designed to be useable within a Pipeline.
When you add a Node to a Pipeline and call `Pipeline.run()`, it calls each Node's `run()` method in the predefined sequence.
The same is true for `Pipeline.run_batch()` that you can use if you want to ask multiple queries. It calls each Node's `run_batch()` method. 

For more information, see the [Pipelines](/components/v1.8.0/pipelines) page.

Alternatively, you can also call the Nodes outside of the Pipeline.
See each individual Node's documentation page to learn more about its available methods.

## Decision Nodes

You can add decision nodes where only one "branch" is executed afterwards.
You can use decision nodes to classify an incoming query and, depending on the result, route it to different modules.
To find a ready-made example of a decision node, have a look at [QueryClassifier](/pipeline_nodes/v1.8.0/query-classifier).

You can also create a custom decision node. To do this, create a class that looks like this:

```python
    class QueryClassifier(BaseComponent):
        outgoing_edges = 2

        def run(self, query):
            if "?" in query:
                return {}, "output_1"

            else:
                return {}, "output_2"

    pipe = Pipeline()
    pipe.add_node(component=QueryClassifier(), name="QueryClassifier", inputs=["Query"])
    pipe.add_node(component=es_retriever, name="ESRetriever", inputs=["QueryClassifier.output_1"])
    pipe.add_node(component=dpr_retriever, name="DPRRetriever", inputs=["QueryClassifier.output_2"])
    pipe.add_node(component=JoinDocuments(join_mode="concatenate"), name="JoinResults",
                  inputs=["ESRetriever", "DPRRetriever"])
    pipe.add_node(component=reader, name="QAReader", inputs=["JoinResults"])
    res = p.run(query="What did Einstein work on?", params={"ESRetriever": {"top_k": 1}, "DPRRetriever": {"top_k": 3}})
```
