# Pipelines

## Flexibility powered by DAGs

To build modern search pipelines, you need two things: powerful building blocks and an easy way to stick them together.
The `Pipeline` class is precisely built for this purpose and enables many search scenarios beyond QA.
The core idea is to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each Node is one building block (Reader, Retriever, Generator).
Here's a simple example for a standard Open-Domain QA Pipeline:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline

p = Pipeline()
p.add_node(component=retriever, name="ESRetriever1", inputs=["Query"])
p.add_node(component=reader, name="QAReader", inputs=["ESRetriever1"])
res = p.run(query="What did Einstein work on?")
```

## Initialize a Pipeline

To start building your custom pipeline, you’ll need to initialize an object of the base Pipeline class:

``` python
from haystack import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline()
```

By default, a new pipeline receives a root node called `Query` or `File` depending on whether it's a Query or Indexing Pipeline, as the entry point to the pipeline graph. You need to manually define how the information flows from one node to the next from that point on.

## Add Nodes to a Pipeline

Use the `add_node()` method to add new components to the pipeline graph. You may either initialize the modules before or during the call to `add_node()`. When you add a node to the pipeline, give it a name and a list of inputs containing one or more items. Note how the default `Query` node acts as the input node to the first explicitly defined node.

``` python
pipeline.add_node(component=retriever, name='Retriever', inputs=['Query'])
```

Here's an example of a node with several input sources:

``` python
pipeline.add_node(component=JoinNode(), name='Joiner',
                  inputs=['Retriever1', 'Retriever2'])
```

If the predecessor node has more than one output, you’ll need to specify the output number in the `inputs` list. For example:

``` python
pipeline.add_node(component=Branch1(), name='Branch1',
                  inputs=['TopicClassifier.output_1'])
pipeline.add_node(component=Branch2(), name='Branch2',
                  inputs=['TopicClassifier.output_2'])
```

Under the hood, the nodes are placed in a queue and executed one by one when the `run()` method is invoked. The output of the last node in the queue is the output of the entire pipeline.

When you create a custom pipeline, you need to pay extra care that each node’s output is compatible with the input of the successive node in the chain. Otherwise, your system will throw an error at runtime.

## Arguments

Each node in a Pipeline defines the arguments the run() method accepts. The Pipeline class takes care of passing relevant
arguments to the node. In addition to mandatory inputs like `query`, the `run()` accepts optional node parameters like
`top_k` with the `params` argument. For instance, `params={"top_k": 5}` will set the `top_k` of all nodes as 5. To
target params to a specific node, the node name can be explicitly specified as `params={"Retriever": {"top_k": 5}}`.


```python
res = pipeline.run(
    query="What did Einstein work on?",
    params={"Retriever": {"top_k": 5}, "Reader": {"top_k": 3}}
)
```

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

## Run a Pipeline

The `run()` function is the single command that triggers the execution of the entire pipeline:

``` python
query = "What's the history of Quidditch?"
pipeline.run(query=query)
```

Every node has its own `run()` method, and the pipeline `run()` call invokes each node, one after the other. When you `run()` a pipeline, all the function arguments are propagated to every node in the graph. To disambiguate, say, the `top_k` values of retriever and ranker, they have aliases that are automatically recognized by the respective modules. This lets you dynamically modify these parameters in each call to the pipeline:

``` python
pipeline.run(query=query, params={"retriever": {"top_k": 28}, "ranker": {"top_k": 9}})
```

## Inspect a Pipeline

### Using `draw()`

The `pipeline.draw()` method generates a sketch of your pipeline. By looking at a drawing of your pipeline, you may be able to confirm that the graph is indeed structured in the way that you intended. This is especially true for customized graphs that may branch out at some point.

## Accessing Pipeline Nodes

If your custom pipeline is not working as intended, try running your nodes in isolation. You may access any pipeline node by using the `get_node()` method and specifying the component's name:

``` python
retriever_node = pipeline.get_node('Retriever')
```

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

## Returning Debugging Information

Nodes in a Pipeline can provide debug information that gets propagated to the final output of a Pipeline.
For instance, a QueryClassifier node can provide the decision it made on a given query.
A Retriever can provide the input query and arguments it received
as well as the candidate documents it retrieved even if it is not the final node in your pipeline.

In Haystack, we provide the option to see the input and output of the node via a `debug` argument.
If you are creating your own custom node, the node will have this debugging functionality as long as you inherit from `BaseComponent`

In all of our nodes, you can enable debugging a few different ways.
You can set the debugging attribute of a node.

```
es_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever(document_store)
es_retriever.debug = True
```

Alternatively, you can provide it as a parameter when running your pipeline.

```
result = pipeline.run(
    query="Who is the father of Arya Stark?",
    params={
        "ESRetriever": {
            "debug": True
        },
        "DPRRetriever": {
            "debug": True
        },
        "Reader": {
            "debug": True
        }
    }
)
```

One final option is to provide `debug` as a global parameter when running your pipeline

```
    result = p_classifier.run(
        query="Who is the father of Arya Stark?",
        params={
            "debug": True
        }
    )
```

When enabled, the debugging information will be stored in the `_debug` key of the dictionary returned by the pipeline.

```
result = pipeline.run(...)
result["_debug"]
```

You can expect a top level key that states the name of the node.
Under that, you can expect an `input` and `output` key.

```
{'ESRetriever': {'input': {'debug': True,
                           'query': 'Who is the father of Arya Stark?',
                           'root_node': 'Query',
                           'top_k': 1},
                 'output': {'documents': [<Document: {'content': "\n===In the Riverlands===\nThe Stark army reaches the Twins, a bridge strong", ...}>]
                            ...}
```

## Custom Debugging Functionality

You can also get a node to return custom debugging information.
To return debug data from a Node, add a `_debug` key in the output dict.
The value should be a dictionary.
For instance,

```
def run(self, query: str):
    if "?" in query:
        return {"_debug": "The query contained a question mark", "output_1"
    else:
        return {"_debug": "The query did not contain a question mark", "output_2"
 ```

This `_debug` gets inserted into the "global" `_debug` dictionary storing debug data for each Node, under the `runtime` key. The final output may look like:

```
{
    "answers": ...,
    "_debug": {
        "node_a": {
            "input": { ... },
            "output": { ... },
            "runtime": "The query contained a question mark"
        },
        "node_b": {
            "input": { ... },
            "output": { ... },
            "runtime": "Some other debug info"
        }
    }
}
```

A Node in a Pipeline can access the global `_debug` from preceding nodes by adding a parameter called `_debug` in its `run()` method:

```python
def run(self, query: str, _debug: dict):
    debug_info = _debug["PrecedingNodeA"]
    ...
 ```

## Running a Node in Isolation

To learn about how to call a single Node outside of a Pipeline, see the [Nodes Usage](/components/nodes#usage) page.

## YAML File Definitions

For your convenience, there is also the option of defining and loading pipelines in YAML files.
Having your pipeline available in a YAML is particularly useful when
you move between experimentation and production environments.
Just export the YAML from your notebook / IDE and import it into your production environment.
It also helps with version control of pipelines, allows you to share your pipeline easily with colleagues,
and simplifies the configuration of pipeline parameters in production.

For example, you can define and save a simple Retriever Reader pipeline by saving the following to a file:

```yaml
version: "0.9"

components: # define all the building-blocks for Pipeline
  - name: MyReader # custom-name for the component; helpful for visualization & debugging
    type: FARMReader # Haystack Class name for the component
    params:
      no_ans_boost: -10
      model_name_or_path: deepset/roberta-base-squad2
  - name: MyESRetriever
    type: ElasticsearchRetriever
    params:
      document_store: MyDocumentStore # params can reference other components defined in the YAML
      custom_query: null
  - name: MyDocumentStore
    type: ElasticsearchDocumentStore
    params:
      index: haystack_test

pipelines: # multiple Pipelines can be defined using the components from above
  - name: my_query_pipeline # a simple extractive-qa Pipeline
    nodes:
      - name: MyESRetriever
        inputs: [Query]
      - name: MyReader
        inputs: [MyESRetriever]
```

The `components` section is used to define the initialization of your [Nodes](/components/nodes).
The `pipelines` section defines how these Nodes are added into the pipeline.
The above example is the equivalent of the following python code.

```
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_node(component=MyRetriever, name="MyESRetriever", inputs=["Query"])
pipeline.add_node(component=MyReader, name='MyReader', inputs=['MyESRetriever'])
```

To load, simply call:

```python
pipeline.load_from_yaml(Path("sample.yaml"))
```

You can also define indexing pipelines via YAML.
Nodes such as the PreProcessor, DocumentClassifier, EntityExtractor, FileTypeClassifier and the Converters are all compatible.

```
pipelines:
- name: indexing
  nodes:
  - inputs:
    - File
    name: FileTypeClassifier
  - inputs:
    - FileTypeClassifier
    name: PdfConverter
  - inputs:
    - PdfConverter
    name: Preprocessor
  - inputs:
    - Preprocessor
    name: DocumentClassifier
  - inputs:
    - DocumentClassifier
    name: DocumentStore
```

## Ready-Made Pipelines

Last but not least, we added some ready-made pipelines that allow you to run standard patterns with very few lines of code. See the [ready-made pipelines page](/components/ready-made-pipelines) and [pipelines API documentation](/reference/pipelines) to learn more about these.

**Examples:**

```python
from haystack.pipelines import DocumentSearchPipeline, ExtractiveQAPipeline
from haystack.nodes import JoinDocuments
from haystack import Pipeline

# Extractive QA
qa_pipe = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader=reader, retriever=retriever)
res = qa_pipe.run(query="When was Kant born?", params={"retriever": {"top_k": 3}, "reader": {"top_k": 5}})

# Document Search
doc_pipe = DocumentSearchPipeline(retriever=retriever)
res = doc_pipe.run(query="Physics Einstein", params={"retriever": {"top_k": 3}})

# Generative QA
doc_pipe = GenerativeQAPipeline(generator=rag_generator, retriever=retriever)
res = doc_pipe.run(query="Physics Einstein", params={"retriever": {"top_k": 3}})

# FAQ based QA
doc_pipe = FAQPipeline(retriever=retriever)
res = doc_pipe.run(query="How can I change my address?", params={"retriever": {"top_k": 3}})

```

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

## Example: Multiple retrievers

You can now also use multiple Retrievers and join their results:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline

p = Pipeline()
p.add_node(component=es_retriever, name="ESRetriever", inputs=["Query"])
p.add_node(component=dpr_retriever, name="DPRRetriever", inputs=["Query"])
p.add_node(component=JoinDocuments(join_mode="concatenate"), name="JoinResults", inputs=["ESRetriever", "DPRRetriever"])
p.add_node(component=reader, name="QAReader", inputs=["JoinResults"])
res = p.run(query="What did Einstein work on?", params={"ESRetriever": {"top_k": 1}, "DPRRetriever": {"top_k": 3}})
```

<div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }} />

## Example: Creating a Retriever-Ranker-Summarizer Pipeline

In this example, we'll look at how to establish a custom Retriever-Ranker-Summarizer pipeline. It's useful to add a `Ranker` to a summarization pipeline because the output of the `Summarizer` depends on the order of the documents that it receives.

``` python
from haystack import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline()
```

To create new pipeline nodes, we initialize the modules first. For our use case, we need a retriever, a ranker, and a summarizer. We tell the summarizer to return a single summary per query (instead of one summary for each document), and that its length should be somewhere between ten and 300 words:

``` python
from haystack.nodes import ElasticsearchRetriever, SentenceTransformersRanker, TransformersSummarizer

retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever(document_store, top_k=10)

ranker = SentenceTransformersRanker(model_name_or_path="cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2", top_k=10)

summarizer = TransformersSummarizer(model_name_or_path='t5-large', min_length=10, max_length=300, generate_single_summary=True)
```

We add the nodes to the pipeline:

``` python
pipeline.add_node(component=retriever, name='Retriever', inputs=['Query'])
pipeline.add_node(component=ranker, name='Ranker', inputs=['Retriever'])
pipeline.add_node(component=summarizer, name='Summarizer', inputs=['Ranker'])
```

Let's now run our custom pipeline on the Harry Potter Wiki dataset. A typical application for this pipeline would be a situation where we want some high-level information about our corpus that is not necessarily contained within one document. We therefore retrieve multiple documents, rank them, and let the summarizer return a single summary of all the texts.

``` python
query = "What's the history of Quidditch?"
result = pipeline.run(query=query)
```

The pipeline returns a dictionary that contains the query, the name of the last node, and a list of documents:

``` python
result.keys()

>>> dict_keys(['documents', 'query', 'node_id'])
```

Since we requested a single summary of all the texts we inputted to the summarizer, the list of documents contains only one item. We access the summary through the text attribute:

``` python
result['documents'][0].text

>>> "the first record of a primitive form of Quidditch (''Kwidditch'') dates to c. 1050. the first known reference to wizards using broomsticks as a means of conveyance dates to A.D. 963. a variant of the game, Quodpot, was invented in the eighteenth century. in the middle of the 14th century it was made a protected species by the wizards council."
```

## Distributed Pipelines with Ray

Ray (https://ray.io) is a framework for distributed computing.

Ray allows distributing a Pipeline's components across a cluster of machines. The individual components of a
Pipeline can be independently scaled. For instance, an extractive QA Pipeline deployment can have three replicas
of the Reader and a single replica for the Retriever. It enables efficient resource utilization by horizontally
scaling Components.

To set the number of replicas, add  `replicas` in the YAML config for the node in a pipeline:

```yaml
components:
    ...

pipelines:
  - name: ray_query_pipeline
    type: RayPipeline
    nodes:
      - name: ESRetriever
        replicas: 2  # number of replicas to create on the Ray cluster
        inputs: [ Query ]
```

A RayPipeline can only be created with a YAML Pipeline config:

```python
from haystack.pipelines import RayPipeline

pipeline = RayPipeline.load_from_yaml(path="my_pipelines.yaml", pipeline_name="my_query_pipeline")
pipeline.run(query="What is the capital of Germany?")
```
By default, RayPipelines creates an instance of RayServe locally. To connect to an existing Ray instance,
set the `address` parameter when creating the RayPipeline instance.
